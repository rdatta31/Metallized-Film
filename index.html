	<h1> Alternate Uses of Wastes Containing Metallized Film  </h1><br>
	<h2> Overview </h2>
	
	<p> Metallized film is a major contributor to environmental damage. Metallized film is a multi-layered film consisting of plastic and a metal commonly found in packaging materials. Since there is no cost effective method of recycling metallized film currently, there is a need to develop alternate ways of reusing metallized film. This project explores the characteristics of metallized film, and uses these to redefine how metallized film can be repurposed.</p>

	<p> This project was completed for the client, Waste Ventures, New Delhi, in collaboration with Dr. Joyelle Harris, Georgia Tech.</p>


	<h2> Properties of Metallized Film </h2>

	<p> There is no cost-effective way of reobtaining metal or plastic from metallied film, because very large quantities of film are required for the process to be cost effective. Some properties of metallized film, which allow for alternate uses, include the following.</p> 
	<p>Thermal Insulation: Metallized Film has significant thermal insulating and reflective properties. The shiny metallized surface reflects incident radiation, making bags with metallized film ideal for use as thermal insulators and reflectors. Metallized film can be used to keep heat out to keep items cold, or to reflect heat back, to keep items warm, for extended periods of time.</p>
	<p>Water-Proofing: Bags made of metallized film demonstrate little to no leakage, even after extended periods of time Such bags can thus be used to contain water and other non-corrosive liquids, and can be used for waterproofing applications.</p>
	<p>High Tensile Strength: Bags connected together using heat treatment methods demonstrated significant tensile strength properties. This makes metallized film a good candidate for rope, used for packaging and purposes.</p>



		
<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>Heat treatment was found to be effective in linking pieces of film together. In this project, a household curling iron was used for 15-20 seconds to form a link. Strips of metallized film were connected via this method, and braided into a rope.</p>
<p>This method was also used to link together flat pieces of metallized film to form reflective thermal blankets, lining for insulating containers, and tarps for waterproofing.</p>
<p> These methods were used by Waste Ventures, New Delhi and the local community to make ropes, which were used for packaging and daily uses. Tarps were used for waterproofing roofs in low-income communities.</p>
